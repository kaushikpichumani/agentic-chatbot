# Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to summarize AI news articles into markdown format. The instructions are pretty detailed. First, I need to extract the date, which should be in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST. Then, create concise summaries for each article. The summaries should be from the latest news, so I need to sort them by date. Also, include the source URL as a link.

Looking at the provided articles, there are 18 entries. I need to parse each one and check the date. The dates are given in GMT, so I have to convert them to IST. Since IST is GMT+5:30, adding that to the GMT time should give the correct date. For example, an article dated Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:25:47 GMT would be 20:55:47 IST on the same day, but the date remains 15 Jan 2026. If the time was close to midnight, I might have to adjust the date, but in this case, all the articles are within the same days. 

Next, I need to create a summary for each article. The summary should be a concise sentence or two capturing the main points. I'll have to read through each article's content and extract the key information. For instance, the Syngenta and SAP partnership article mentions modernizing operations with AI, so the summary should highlight that collaboration. The AIIMS doctor article is about the risks of using ChatGPT for health, so the summary should mention the concerns raised.

Sorting them by date, latest first. The latest date is 16 Jan 2026, and there are several articles from that day. Then the 15th. I need to group them by date and list them in descending order. For each date, list the summaries with their URLs linked. 

I also need to ensure the markdown format is correct. The dates should be in ### [Date] format, followed by bullet points with the summary and URL. Also, check for any duplicate articles or those that might not be relevant. For example, the article from timesofindia.indiatimes.com has a horoscope and unrelated topics, so maybe that's not needed. The user might want only AI-related articles, so I should filter out any that don't pertain to AI.

Wait, the user provided all the articles, so maybe I should check each one. Let me go through each article again. The one about Texas AI law is relevant. The one about Snapchat and commerce is about AI marketing. The article about Apple using Google's models is relevant. The one about Indra's contract in London mentions AI employees on a billboard, which might be relevant. 

I need to make sure the summaries are concise and capture the AI aspect. For example, the Hitachi investment in AI mining tech should mention the $3 million investment and the rebranding. The Recursion article is about a CEO change, which is more about leadership than AI, but the company is in AI drug discovery, so maybe include it. 

Also, check for any articles that might be duplicates. The one about OpenAI's investor letter and the one from CNBC about Demis Hassabis might be related but are separate articles. The TSMC article is about profit due to AI demand. The Skild AI article about their model is relevant. 

Once all summaries are written, arrange them by date. The latest date is 16 Jan 2026, then 15 Jan 2026. Each date entry groups the summaries for that day. 

Now, converting the dates. Let's take the first article: "Date: Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:35:04 GMT". Adding 5:30 hours gives 10:35:04 IST on the same day. The date remains 16 Jan. Similarly for others. 

Need to check all dates and ensure the summaries are correctly attributed. Once that's done, format the markdown as specified.
